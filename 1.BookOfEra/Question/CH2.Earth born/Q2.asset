  QuestionEnglish: The force of the moon-forming impact left Earth as a churning,
    hot magma blob. When the planet eventually cooled down, the lava solidified into
    rock, and liquid water began to condense, forming Earth's first ocean. The oldest
    minerals found on Earth, called zircons, date back to this time and are 4.4 billion
    years old.
