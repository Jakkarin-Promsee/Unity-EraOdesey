  QuestionEnglish: How did life first life? Lightning may have played a crucial role
    in providing the spark needed for life to begin. Electric sparks can generate
    amino acids and sugars from the primitive Earth's atmosphere, helping to create
    the essential building blocks of life. Over millions of years, these building
    blocks gradually evolved into complex creatures.
