  QuestionEnglish: In the Hadean Eon, approximately 4.6 to 4.0 billion years ago
    during the first Precambrian era, a Mars-sized planet collided with Earth, contributing
    to approximately 10% of Earth's mass. As a result of this collision, some parts
    of Earth separated to form another planet.
