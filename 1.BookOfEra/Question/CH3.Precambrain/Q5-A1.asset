  QuestionEnglish: The Earth was extremely cool, with temperatures low enough to
    freeze everything when 4.6 billion to 4.0 billion years ago. Subsequently, the
    Earth began warming, eventually giving rise to the first life forms. Finally,
    approximately 2.5 to 0.5 billion years ago, the Earth continued to warm, leading
    to the melting of the seas.
